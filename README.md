# Wattle Framework
WattleFlow is a lightweight `ETL` framework for data engineers. The framework is based on design patterns using a small footprint that provides flexibility to build bespoke ETL pipelines using YAML configuration file.

## Exampes
The framework tests can be found in the `examples` folder. This will help you  with learning process on how to use framwork and develop your own `extraction`, `transformation` and `load` elemtns of the piplines. Examples will demonstrate how to utilise YAML to create your ETL pipeline as you apply simple builiding blocks that ensure fast deployment and reusability of your code.
